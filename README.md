# Excel

## Description
I used the retail_sales_dataset_master for this project. My aim was to clean the dataset and then analyse the data for the insights I was looking to answer. I also created a basic raw dataset which I used to create pivot tables. Also used was a bike sales dataset.

## Data
The datasets were sourced from www.kaggle.com.

## Tools Used
- Microsoft Excel.

## Steps Taken

### Task 1

- Using the retail_sales_dataset I first added two new columns to the data. Column one was Total Sales and column 2 was Commission rate 2023. The comission rate was defined at 2% for year 2023 and 1.5% for year 2024.
- Total sales were added up and added to the Toatal sales column and the commission rates were added.

- The next task I undertook was to show the performance of students in 3 lessons. I first used conditional formatting to place coloured markings by each score to show who was struggling and who were managing and completing the classes.
- I then worked out te average score of each student and again formatted these using traffic light colours to who was top and bottom of the spectrum.
- The last step was to identify each students top score.

### Task 2

- Using the Bike sales dataset my aim was to create a pivot table of the raw data to find which countries had what sales and for which product those sales were for.

### Task 3

- I made up a dataset for this task which contained County, Product and Sales volume.
- My next task was to create a new column which showed the sales volumes in text format.
- From this I then created a pivot table to show the totals of products sold by county and the grand total of each county.

### Task 4

- Again using the Bike sales data. I created visulisations of the raw data using pivot tables and graphs.
